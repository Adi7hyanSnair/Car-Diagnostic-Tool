# Car-Telemetry-System

This is a project I chose to do in my First year of Under graduate Academics in the year 2024. 
This project is also part of my internal assesment of my Object orinted Programming in java course.

### Day 1

One of the biggest task was choosing the topic for my project. So i went through some series of steps to finally choose my subject.
First thing I did was searching for that onething that i was more interested in. The one thing I am very much interested and passionate
about is cars and automobiles. 

So After that I was curiously searching for a topic that relates to cars or automobies.
With the help AI I got way too many topics based on cars. Some of the topics I shortlisted includes Car Diagnostic Tool, Autonomous Vehicle 
Simulation Game, Vehicle efficiency Monitoring App, Vehicle theft Prevention system, Vehicle Tracking System, Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Monioring System.

From these Topics I shorlisted 3 topics Autonomous Vehicle Simulation Game, Car Diagnostic Tool, Car Telemetry System. Then I took out Autonomous Vehicle 
Simulation Game because I was Not that much Confident in doing this project as this project was harder that the others and it will cost my time. As A First year B. Tech 
Computer Science Engineering (AI) student The hardet thing I went through was managing my time.

Finally I was stuck at the remaing 2 topics which are Car Telemetry System and Car Diagnostic Tool
#### Car Telemetry System
A car telemetry system is like a remote monitoring system for your car. It uses sensors and software to:

* Collect data: Sensors throughout the car constantly measure things like engine performance, speed, fuel level, and even tire pressure.
* Transmit data: This data is wirelessly sent to a central location (computer, phone app)
* Analyze data: The system can analyze the data to identify trends, potential problems, or areas for improvement.
  
Think of it as a fitness tracker for your car, giving you valuable insights into its health and performance.
#### Car Diagnostic Tool
A car diagnostic tool acts like a mechanic's stethoscope for your car's computer. Here's a quick rundown:

* Plugs into your car: It connects to a special port (OBD-II) usually located under the dashboard.
* Reads car computer: The tool talks to the car's onboard computer system which monitors various parts.
* Checks for trouble: It scans for error codes stored by the computer, indicating potential problems.
* Provides information: The tool might display the error code and a basic explanation, helping you pinpoint the issue.
  
Think of it as a preliminary check engine light explainer. It can't fix the problem itself, but it gives you a starting point for diagnosis and repair.

Finally I Chose Car Telemetry System without much specific reason.
